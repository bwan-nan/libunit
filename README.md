### Rush - Introduction to unit testing

A rush is a group project done during a whole weekend. The group is of composed 2 or 3 randomly matched people.
<br /><br />
The purpose of this one was to understand the basics of unit testing and the importance of it.<br />
We developped in 2 days a unit test Lib that is able to test the proper functioning of [our very first school project Libft](https://github.com/bwan-nan/libft.git) (where we recoded about 50 functions of the standard C Library).

<br /><br />
Due to a lack of time, we only did a few tests, and could not add the Continuous Integration module.<br />
This project is therefore nothing but a proof of work.<br /> 

How to use:

    git clone https://github.com/bwan-nan/libunit.git
    Go to the tests folder and run "make test" to see what kind of tests the framework does
    Go to the real-tests folder and run "make test" to actually see the tests on working and non-working functions.
